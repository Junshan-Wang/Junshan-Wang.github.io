### A Deep Spatial-Temporal Ensemble Model for Air Quality Prediction
Air quality has drawn much attention on the recent years because it seriously affects people’s health. Nowadays, people strongly desire air quality prediction, which is a challenging problem as it depends on several complicated factors, such as weather patterns and spatial-temporal dependencies of air quality. In this paper, we design a data-driven approach that utilizes historical air quality and meteorological data to predict air quality in the future. We propose a deep spatial-temporal ensemble(STE) model which is comprised of three components. The first component is an ensemble method to handle different weather patterns. The second one is spatial correlation exploration. The last one is a temporal predictor based on LSTM. We evaluate our model with data from 35 monitoring stations in Beijing, China. The experiments show that each component of our model makes contribution to the improvement in prediction accuracy and the model is superior to baselines.

### Inferring Explicit and Implicit Social Ties Simultaneously in Mobile Social Network
In mobile social network, social tie recognition is a significant task. A great portion of relations are hidden from the interactions in mobile social network. Inferring these implicit social ties can be applied in many aspects like recommender system. But it is challenging because there isn’t any explicit interaction information of these implicit ties in mobile social network. In this paper, we propose a community-based recognition model to infer explicit and implicit social ties simultaneously. Firstly, we observe community features by empirical analysis. It shows that communities with different relation types have different features. Secondly, we propose a communal factor graph to infer social ties. We extract community features, build up a community layer that treats each community as a node. We experiment our model on both implicit and explicit ties and results confirm that using our community features based model can reach a better recognition result.

### SimRank for Medical Disease Named Entity Disambiguation
Nowadays, many medical units use electronic information system to manage a huge amount of medical data. But the names written by doctors are usually irregular or have some sematic mistakes. It's meaningful but challenging to map the non-standard medical disease names into standard ones, whihc is called medical disease named entity disambiguation. We adopt a SimRank based method to solve the problem. Not only the textual similarity but the structural information is used for disambiguation.
